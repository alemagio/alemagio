## Hi I'm Alessandro 👋

I started coding when I was at the University but I always tought about it like real magic, since I was around 10.
I always play the wizard 🧙‍♂️ in every game and I'm a huge Harry Potter fan (ask me anything and I'll prove it 💬).
So basically being a coder, to me, feels like the closest thing to a wizard I could be 😄.

I am a backend developer and I work with Nodejs, Typescript and MongoDB.

During the night (and saturday morning) I contribute to open source. Mostly Javascript and Node projects and [Fastify](https://www.fastify.io/) has become my framework of choice for my side-projects.
